/* Create a counter in JavaScript

We have already covered this in the second lesson, but as an easy recap try to code a counter in Javascript
It should go up as time goes by in intervals of 1 second*/

var counter = 1 

function printAndIncreaseCounter(){
    console.clear()
    console.log(counter) // prints out current value on screen
    counter++
}

setInterval(printAndIncreaseCounter, 1000)
